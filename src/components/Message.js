                <p>The Indian Economy is being considered as one of the fastest growing and emerging economies in recent times.
                  The major reason behind the same is its strength in human resources. Being the second most populated country in the world, India can gain greater development if it handles its human resources appropriately both by government as well as individuals and institutions. And one such measure is the provision of qualitative education of highest standard from any measurable angle.</p>
                  <p>Qualitative higher and technical education holds an edge in transforming human beings into human capital and
                      human resource. Institutions of higher learning such Central University Jamia Millia Islamia is committed to the task
                      of reducing/bridging this gap.</p>

                      institutions and industry. We have a strong placement team with experienced senior professor heading, to guide
                      the talented and enthusiast youth by providing direction in order to attain right placements which smoothens life???s
