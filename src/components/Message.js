                <p>The Indian Economy is being considered as one of the fastest growing and emerging economies in recent times.
                  The major reason behind the same is its strength in human resources. Being the second most populated country in the world, India can gain greater development if it handles its human resources appropriately both by government as well as individuals and institutions. And one such measure is the provision of qualitative education of highest standard from any measurable angle.</p>
                  <p>Qualitative higher and technical education holds an edge in transforming human beings into human capital and
                      human resource. Institutions of higher learning such Central University Jamia Millia Islamia is committed to the task
                      of reducing/bridging this gap.</p>
                      <p>In this endeavor, Department of Computer Science of Jamia Millia Islamia has enriched its programmes through
                      complete overhauling of course structure, syllabus updated with contemporary requirements of the universities,
                      institutions and industry. We have a strong placement team with experienced senior professor heading, to guide
                      the talented and enthusiast youth by providing direction in order to attain right placements which smoothens lifeâ€™s
                      journey for self and future generations.</p>
                      <p>The department boasts of availability of the state of the art infrastructure as well as highly motivated and qualified faculty members and staff to guide the youth, which in turn has also been reflected in the overall performance
                      of the students.</p>
