(1) Please write proper comments so it could make it more readable for others
(2) For each section there should be a seperate css file and avoid over-ridding parent classes rather make seperate classes in case you use the same class name in different places
(3) Avoid redundancy of code, rather make a reusable section and import it wherever required
(4) Please follow the project structure throughout
